# Podcaster app

podcaster is a platform (fullstack web application) which allows to listen, upload and interact with podcasts.

# Stack

Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, RSpec, Turbo, Stimulus

# The meaning

That application doesnt have any affect on industry, dont have any proposes how to create similar project better or etc. For me is a good chance to practice interaction with stimulus.js and explore interaction js with files. Also it's a good practice to create full stack application :)

Also, I have the main task of creating a large-scale application with some logic and I decided to split the application into small applications and after gaining experience, move on to creating a great project.
